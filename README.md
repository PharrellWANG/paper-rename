Rename Academic Papers
======================

Because downloaded papers seldom have names that a human can identify.

Usage
-----

Add `paper-rename.py` to your path. Then run:

```sh
paper-rename.py paper.pdf
```

Known Issues
------------

Papers which have journal names written at the top are incorrectly parsed. I haven't been able to simple solution to this problem. Contributions are welcome.
